This document describes the requirements for the REST client testing tool. The template for the Software
Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.

%==============================================================================
\section{Project Drivers}
%==============================================================================



\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Web services developed using web application programming interface (API) are omnipresent. Web APIs offers a powerful platform that enables HTTP services to a broad range of clients including browsers, mobiles, and desktops. They are created based on the representational state transfer (REST) framework that presents guidelines acting as a standard for Web APIs. It is critical to be able to test the API functionalities during its development stage. The reconstruction of the Sails Live Chrome app will provide software developers a tool in Web API building and testing. The application will provide tests endpoints and the capability to diagnose bugs in applications featuring RESTful interfaces.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stakeholders include the project team members developing the project who are learning about the software engineering project development process and the McMaster University Software Engineering 3XA3 course teaching staff who are invested in the educational value of the project for the development team. The product is not developed for commercial sale to customers, but rather as an open source utility tool free to developers who see a need for it. Therefore, the team itself is putting their own resources into the project.

\subsubsection{The Client}
%------------------------------------------------------
The client is Professor Asghar Bokhari who is teaching the McMaster University Software Engineering 3XA3 course. Since the project is intended to be open source and the core project team sets the project direction, desired features and software requirements for the product, they may be considered as both the clients and the stakeholders.

\subsubsection{The Customers}
%------------------------------------------------------
The customers are developers who have a need for a REST client for testing their app. However, there app is a free utility, so they will not be paying customers.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
%------------------------------------------------------
Given the limited scope of the project, there are no other stakeholders beyond what has been listed above.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}

The product shall operate on up-to-date versions of Windows, Mac, Linux operating systems with up-to-date versions of Chrome browsers installed that allow JavaScript to run. Rationale: Target client are users of up-to-date Windows, Mac, Linux operating systems with JavaScript client. 


The product shall operate with a working and secure Internet connection with a download speed above 5 Mbps and an upload speed above 1 Mbps. The desired Internet connection speed is directly proportional to the quantity of data clients require for the testing of their specific web APIs (higher Internet connection speed is desired for applications with higher data traffic).
Rationale: The product uses Internet connection to serve REST requests to required resources and to display request responses.

The product shall comply with Canadian federal privacy laws (Privacy Act and Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) and other relevant legal requirements. Rationale: The product should not breach legal requirements in the intended operating environment.


\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
The execution of product requires the following off-the-shelf software:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Google Chrome web browser
	\item Client on which Chrome apps can be installed  
	\item JavaScript
\end{itemize}
All of the above are freely available on the Internet.

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}
A working product must be completed to a state demonstrating full functionality for final demonstration by Nov 27, 2017. The product shall be completed for product release (along with all final documentation) by Dec 6, 2017.

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}
The expected operation budget for the product is \$0, thus requirements for purchasing materials and other product needs are not applicable. Any unplanned purchases and costs during the development process are expected to be covered by the project team out of pocket.

\subsubsection{Enterprise Constraints}
The product is open-source and therefore freely accessible to all users with the technology and platform to run Chrome applications and JavaScript.

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{itemize}
	\item HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
	\item REST: Representational state transfer (REST) or RESTful web services is a way of providing interoperability between computer systems on the Internet.
	\item JSON: JavaScript Object Notation. An open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value).
	\item API: Application Program Interface. A document detailing the name of each function the client may call in their software and the purpose of those functions.
	\item Functional Requirements: Requirements that describes what the product will do.
	\item User: A person who will be using the final product.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is assumed that the users will be software developers with a basic understanding of REST interfaces and the HTTP protocol.

	\end{figure}
\end{center}
\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
%------------------------------------------------------
The recreation of the app is not limited to any particular platform since most devices are able to support the Chrome web browser and run JavaScript. The reproduction of the app will remove the limitation presented by Sails Live that users can interface with only the Sails server. Instead, the reproduced app aim to enable communication with interfaces featuring RESTful Web APIs not limited to Sails.

\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}
%------------------------------------------------------
Not relevant for this project.

\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not applicable to this project.

\subsection{Risks}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
One risk factor involved with the project is that automated testing may be difficult to implement due to variation in request responses to applications featuring live outputs (such as Twitter API). The project has been through a preliminary round of evaluation by the teaching staff of the course to ensure the planned scope has maximum potential for project success. However, in case the scope of the project is too large to complete within the designated project time line, there may be need to narrow the scope of the project to allow project completion.

\subsection{Costs}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The product is projected to incur no monetary cost as long as services such as source code hosting and version control systems are free of cost to the project team. The main cost is the time of the project team members who develop and maintain the product.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is important for users to learn how to use the application. Simple annotated screen shots will be provided to explain how to use the basic functions of the application.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features that are considered for future releases include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Socket connection support for remote applications and interfaces 
	\item Real-time payload validation (JSON validation)
	\item Request management (edit, remove, sort or inspect created requests)
	\item Event registration (on which the connected socket should listen to)
	\item Create, manage and inspect listeners
	\item Observe realtime notifications
	\item Collapsable response inspector
	\item Listener queue (list and save all incoming events with date and time information)
	\item Multiple connections (select the socket you need for each request and listener)
	\item Connection history
	\item Automated API tests with configuration
	\item Import/Export of custom settings
\end{itemize}
